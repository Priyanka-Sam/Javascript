Hoisting  - make some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared "Variables lifted to the tp pf the cope"

Before execution code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable a  new property is created in the Varaible Environment Object


                          Hoisted?    Initial Value       Scope
function declarations       Yes       Actual function     Block  
var variables               Yes         undefined        Function
let and const               Not           TDZ             Block
                     (techinally yes)  (unintialized) 
func expressions/arrows  depends or if you use let/const



Why TDZ(Temporal dead Zone) ?
makes it easier to avoid and catch errors, accessing variables before declarartion is bad practice and should be avoided

make const variables work the way they work
